# mediCal-Backend
  Created and Developped by: Jen Wong, Kathryn Zaharek, Seymur Mammadov and Paul Raucci
## Purpose
  The mediCal scheduling system gives users an easy option to quickly find all upcoming medical appointments, edit upcoming medical appointments, attach messages to appointments to help Doctors quickly assess the patients needs. Upon logging in/creating account patients are brought to dashboard where the patient can see/edit appointments; administrators will be brought to a separate dashboard with current and upcoming appointments, messages from patients.
## Application URL
* [mediCal]
## Technologies
* Node.js
* React
* MongoDB
* CSS / Bootstrap
## Approach
  Alot of online sports magazines have great articles, some will give information on team records and maybe even an upcoming game or two. What I was looking to accomplish was make an easy application that would give the user all of a specific NBA teams games for a season.
	
## Difficulties
  In the backend of this application a few roadblock were encountered.
## Future Updates
  A few things that I would like to add to this application would be displaying wins/losses, toggling the season and displaying a mini box score etc...
